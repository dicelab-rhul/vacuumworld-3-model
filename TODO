1) Remove the code duplications in VacuumWorldCleaningAgent and VacuumWorldUserAgent.
2) Unify the JSON parsers / generators. Maybe extract some methods to vwcommon?
3) Make the delay (excluding the syncronization latency) between cycles - currently 0.75 seconds, hardcoded in VacuumWorldEnvironment - configurable.
4) Write a whole lot of tests.
