This list is in random order (for now), i.e., in no priority order.

1) Implement VacuumWorldAvatar, and related classes.
2) Unify the JSON parsers / generators. Maybe extract some methods to vwcommon?
3) Make the delay (excluding the syncronization latency) between cycles - currently 0.75 seconds, hardcoded in VacuumWorldEnvironment - configurable.
4) Write a whole lot of tests.
5) Are all the JUnit dependencies really needed? (W.r.t. the tests that need to be written)
6) Port the whole project (plus view and controller) to Spring.
7) Implement VacuumWorldPrologMind.
